This is a software to count none-repeating ip addresses lines in 1Gb+ files.  

To work with the application you have to create 2 environment variables:
1. PATH_TO_HUGE_FILE
2. HUGE_FILE_NAME

You can put your own file to the PATH_TO_HUGE_FILE, or you can 
run IPAddrGenerator.main to create huge file.
