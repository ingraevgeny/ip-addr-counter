To work with the application you have to create 2 environment variables:
1. PATH_TO_HUGE_FILE
2. HUGE_FILE_NAME

You can put your own file to the PATH_TO_HUGE_FILE, or you can 
run IPAddrGenerator.main

I have Internet only via my phone, and I can't download your huge file, that's why I wrote my own IPAddrGenerator.
